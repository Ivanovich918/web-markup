            <p>Getting enough protein is critical for gaining muscle.</p>

            <p>Specifically, to gain muscle, you need to consume more protein than your body breaks down through natural
                processes.</p>

            <p>While it&apos;s possible to get all the protein you need from protein-rich foods, some people may struggle to
                do so.</p>

            <p>If this sounds like you, you may want to consider taking a protein supplement.</p>

            <p>There are many different protein supplements available, but some</p>
            <p>of the most popular are whey, casein, and soy protein. Other supplements contain protein isolated from
                eggs, split peas, rice, and hemp seeds.</p>
