            </header>
            <p>Amino acids are organic compounds composed mainly of nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.</p>

            <p>Your body needs 20 different amino acids to grow and function properly.
                While all 20 of these are important for your health, only 9 are classified as essential </p>

            <p>Additionally, certain amino acids, including glycine and arginine,
                are considered conditionally essential during pregnancy because
                a pregnant person needs more of these amino acids to support their own health and the health of the
                fetus</p>

            <p>Your body can&apos;t produce the nine essential amino acids, so you need to get them from your diet.
                Conditionally essential amino acids are nonessential amino acids that become essential in certain
                circumstances, such as illness or pregnancy.</p>
