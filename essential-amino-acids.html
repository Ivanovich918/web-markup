                <h1>Essential amino acids</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Amino acids are organic compounds composed mainly of nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.</p>

            <p>Your body needs 20 different amino acids to grow and function properly.
                While all 20 of these are important for your health, only 9 are classified as essential </p>

            <p>Additionally, certain amino acids, including glycine and arginine,
                are considered conditionally essential during pregnancy because
                a pregnant person needs more of these amino acids to support their own health and the health of the
                fetus</p>

            <p>Your body can&apos;t produce the nine essential amino acids, so you need to get them from your diet.
                Conditionally essential amino acids are nonessential amino acids that become essential in certain
                circumstances, such as illness or pregnancy.</p>

                <h2>How to supplement with essential amino acids</h2>
                <p>Most people get enough essential amino acids through their diet.</p>

                <p>However, there are some benefits to taking essential amino acid supplements. For example,
                    athletes often take them to enhance exercise performance and recovery.</p>

                <p>One review that included 10 high quality studies found that doses of BCAAs of up to 115.6 mg per
                    lb (255 mg per kg) per day could help reduce delayed onset muscle soreness in trained
                    individuals after exercise.</p>

                <p>Additionally, people may choose to take individual amino acids, rather than blends, to support
                    certain aspects of health, such as mood.</p>

                <p>A review that included 11 high quality studies found that taking 0.14-3 g of tryptophan per day
                    could help improve mood in healthy people.</p>
