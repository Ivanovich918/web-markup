            <p>Getting enough protein is critical for gaining muscle.</p>

            <p>Specifically, to gain muscle, you need to consume more protein than your body breaks down through natural
                processes.</p>

            <p>While it&apos;s possible to get all the protein you need from protein-rich foods, some people may
                struggle to
                do so.</p>

            <p>If this sounds like you, you may want to consider taking a protein supplement.</p>

            <p>There are many different protein supplements available, but some of the most popular are whey, casein,
                and soy protein. Other supplements contain protein isolated from
                eggs, split peas, rice, and hemp seeds.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Whey is an excellent source of high quality protein</h2>
                <p>Whey is a liquid that separates from milk during cheese production. The protein part of whey is
                    called whey protein.</p>

                <p>It is a complete, high quality protein that contains all of the essential amino acids. In addition,
                    it is very digestible, absorbed from your gut quickly compared with other types of protein.</p>

                <p>These qualities make it one of the best dietary sources of protein available.</p>

                    are getting enough protein in your diet, taking a protein supplement is unnecessary.</figcaption>
