                <h1>Creatine</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Creatine is a molecule that&apos;s produced naturally in your body. It provides energy for your muscles
                and
                other tissues.</p>

            <p>However, taking it as a dietary supplement can increase muscle creatine content by up to 40%Trusted
                Source beyond its normal levels.</p>

            <p>This affects your muscle cells and exercise performance, promoting muscle gain. In fact, a large amount
                of researchTrusted Source shows creatine improves muscle strength.</p>

            <p>This is good news if you&apos;re trying to gain muscle. Greater strength allows you to perform better
                during
                exercise, leading to larger increases in muscle mass over time.</p>

            <p>Creatine can also increase water content in your muscle cells. This may cause your muscle cells to swell
                slightly and produce signals for muscle growth.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, this supplement may increase levels of the hormones involved in muscle growth, such as
                IGF-1.</p>
            <p>Moreover, some researchTrusted Source shows that creatine could decrease the breakdown of proteins in
                your muscles.</p>

            <p>Overall, many researchers have studiedTrusted Source creatine supplements and exercise, and one thing is
                clear â€” creatine can help increase muscle mass.</p>

            <p>Creatine has also been studied extensively and has an outstanding safety profile.</p>

            <p>If you are looking for a supplement to help you gain muscle, consider creatine first.</p>
